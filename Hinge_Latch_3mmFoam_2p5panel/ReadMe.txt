These were made to accomodate for 3mm thick foamtape instead of 1mm foamtape.
It's the basic hinges and latches with more distance to the extrusions.
VHB tape was also included in calculations.

				###### Keep in mind ######
The formbot kid I received came with 2.5MM THICK PANELS instead of 3mm
For that reason I recommend the "..-04p" version which gives the panels just that much more squeeze on the foamtape to really close of any potential gaps for draft.
